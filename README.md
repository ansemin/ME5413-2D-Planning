# **Summary of Homework Report for ME5413: Autonomous Mobile Robotics**

- **Group 28:** Anse Min, Huang Yiming, Niu Dixiao (Master of Science students at NUS, in Robotics and Mechanical Engineering)
- **Supervisor:** Prof. Marcelo H Ang Jr
- **Date:** 3/4/2024

**Key Contents:**

## 1. **Task 1 - Global Planning:**
   - Explored A* algorithm for pathfinding. Key steps include initialization, exploration, costing, obstacle checking, and path backtracking. 
   - Compared Euclidean, Manhattan, and Chebyshev heuristic functions, finding minimal differences except in certain scenarios.
   - Analyzed the impact of swapping start and goal positions on path calculation.

## 2. **Task 2 - Travelling Shopper Problem:**
   - Implemented and compared brute force and nearest neighbor algorithms for the problem.
   - Brute force algorithm guarantees the optimal solution but is computationally intensive.
   - Nearest neighbor offers a more efficient, though possibly suboptimal, solution.
   - Detailed comparison of both algorithms in terms of performance and limitations.

## 3. **Task 3 (Bonus) - Controller Evaluation:**
   - Discussed PID and Stanley controllers for vehicle navigation, emphasizing parameter adjustments for optimal performance.
   - Evaluated the performance of adjusted controllers, demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy.
   - Attempted to implement an MPC controller but reverted to PID due to challenges.

**Figures & Tables:**
- Included visual representations of pathfinding algorithms and controller performances.
- Comparative analyses of heuristic functions and algorithm efficiencies.

**Appendices:**
- Contains pseudo-code for A* search, brute force, and nearest neighbor algorithms.

For detailed findings and analyses, refer to the respective sections of the report.
